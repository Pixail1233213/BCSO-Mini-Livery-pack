# BCSO-Mini-Livery-pack
This Is my first Livery Pack that i have Made i will come out with more in the near future but for now this is all i have

Installation Instructions This is howw you install the liverys not cars

Once in Open IV go in to edit mode then find the ytd file of the car open it and search sign you will see 1 or more signs those are the liverys you want to make sure the livery that you put in is the has the same name as the one you remove once you change the names to the same thing you will press replace and find the livery that you are going to put in then you will click it press open to change it then save it the name should look something like this cvpi_sign_1 to add multiple liverys you will just simple do the same thing but you would name it with a 2 instead of a one and just going on and on

You may reupload this but i want full credit for my work and DO NOT CLAIM IT AS YOUR OWN
